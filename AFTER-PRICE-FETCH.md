tail -f logs/price-fetch-fixed.log
```

## What If It Fails?

### Check for Errors

```bash
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" logs/price-fetch-fixed.log
```

### Common Issues

python3 scripts/fetch-prices.py --limit 100
```

**2. Network Timeout**
```bash
# Already handled in code with 20s timeout
