## Approach

**FREE AI Generation** - Since I AM Claude Code, I generate descriptions directly:
- No API calls
- No costs
- High quality 400-word descriptions
- Cultural context and authentic storytelling
- Optimized for AI answer engines

## Next Steps

1. Continue enriching events in batches of 10-20
2. Monitor price fetcher completion (86% → ~90%+)
3. Rebuild site when both processes complete
4. Deploy to Netlify

## Notes

- All descriptions follow 400-word target (±20 acceptable)
- Focus on cultural context, venue atmosphere, artist background
- No fabricated information - only from provided data
- Optimized for both human readers and AI answer engines
