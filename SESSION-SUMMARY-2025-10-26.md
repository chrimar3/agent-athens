**Status**: Price fetcher currently running in background

### Automation Status
✅ **Email Ingestion**: Implemented (`src/ingest/email-ingestion.ts`)
✅ **Web Scraping**: Automated (`scripts/scrape-all-sites.py`)
✅ **Database Deduplication**: Working (event ID hashing)
✅ **Static Site Generation**: Working (`bun run build`)
✅ **Auto-deployment**: Working (git push → Netlify)
⚠️  **Price Fetching**: Partial (works for more.com, issues with viva.gr)

## Known Issues

### 1. viva.gr Price Fetching (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: 1,030 events from viva.gr domain cannot fetch prices
**Cause**: Connection timeouts (ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR)
**Temporary Solution**: Skip viva.gr URLs for now
**Permanent Solution Needed**: 
- Investigate viva.gr API or alternative data source
- Try different HTTP client (requests instead of Playwright)
- Contact viva.gr for API access

### 2. Zero AI Enrichment (Low Priority)
**Status**: 0 events have 400-word AI descriptions
**Impact**: Missing rich SEO/AI content
**Solution**: Run `bun run scripts/enrich-events.ts`
**Time**: ~2-3 hours for all 3,121 events

### 3. Empty Genre Pages (Low Priority)
**Status**: Genre pages exist but have 0 events
**Cause**: Events lack genre metadata
**Solution**: Enhance scrapers to extract genre data

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate
1. ⏳ Monitor price fetcher completion (running now)
2. 📦 Rebuild site after price fetcher completes
3. 🚀 Deploy updated site with improved pricing

### Short Term
1. 🔍 Investigate viva.gr pricing alternative approach
2. 🤖 Run AI enrichment on all events
3. 📊 Update README.md with current stats

### Medium Term
1. 🏷️ Add genre classification to events
2. 🖼️ Add event images/posters
3. 📅 Implement recurring events tracking
4. 🔌 Create API endpoints for programmatic access
