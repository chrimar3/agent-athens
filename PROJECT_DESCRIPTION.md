# agent-athens

**AI-curated cultural events calendar for Athens, Greece - optimized for AI agents and humans alike.**

## What It Is

agent-athens is an autonomous event curation system that generates 315+ SEO/GEO-optimized static pages from daily-updated Athens cultural event data. Built for the post-LLM era where AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) are primary discovery channels.

## Core Value Proposition

**Single authoritative source** for Athens events that:
- Updates daily at 8:00 AM Athens time
- Provides machine-readable structured data (Schema.org)
- Generates every meaningful filter combination as standalone pages
- Serves both humans (HTML) and AI agents (JSON/MCP/A2A)

## Technical Architecture

**Input:**
- 20+ Athens events (concerts, exhibitions, cinema, theater, workshops)
- Ingested via email newsletters from 10+ verified venues
- Curated and enriched using Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Processing:**
- TypeScript/Bun static site generator
- Combinatorial SEO: Type Ã— Time Ã— Price Ã— Genre = 315 pages
- URL pattern: `/{price}-{genre}-{type}-{time}` (e.g., `/free-jazz-concert-today`)

**Output:**
- 315 HTML pages with full SEO/GEO optimization
- 315 JSON API endpoints (same data, different format)
- Discovery files: llms.txt, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- Schema.org markup for AI consumption

## Key Differentiators

1. **Combinatorial SEO**: Every filter combination gets a unique, keyword-rich URL
2. **GEO-first**: Built for Generative Engine Optimization (AI citations)
3. **Freshness signals**: Daily updates with explicit timestamps for AI trust
4. **Multi-access**: HTML (humans), JSON (developers), MCP (AI assistants), A2A (agent network)
5. **Multiplier effect**: 20 events â†’ 315 pages (15.75x coverage)

## Use Cases

**For Humans:**
- "What's happening in Athens this weekend?" â†’ `/this-weekend`
- "Free concerts today?" â†’ `/free-concert-today`
- "Indie music this week?" â†’ `/indie-concert-this-week`

**For AI Agents:**
- ChatGPT citations in travel recommendations
- Perplexity answers for "Athens events"
- Calendar apps via JSON API
- Personal AI assistants via MCP protocol

**Phase 4**: Expand to other cities (agent-barcelona, agent-berlin)
**Phase 5**: Become global cultural events platform for the AI era
