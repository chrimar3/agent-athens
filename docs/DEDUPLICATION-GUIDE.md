```bash
bun run scripts/remove-duplicates.ts --dry-run
```
Shows what would be removed without making changes.

### Apply Changes
```bash
bun run scripts/remove-duplicates.ts
```
Removes duplicates and updates the database.

## The 6 Deduplication Passes

### PASS 1: URL-Based Deduplication (PRIMARY KEY) 🔑

**What it catches**: Events with the same URL but different titles

**Example**:
```
URL: https://more.com/brian-jackson
- "BRIAN JACKSON" (scraped early)
- "Brian Jackson (US) ζωντανά στην Αθήνα" (scraped later)
→ Keeps the version with longer title + better description
```

**Why it's first**: URL is the most reliable unique identifier. Same URL = same event, always.

**Keeps**:
1. Preferred source (more.com > viva.gr > gazarte.gr)
2. Longest title (more descriptive)
3. Longest description (most detail)

---

### PASS 2: Exact Match (Title + Venue + Date) 🎯

**What it catches**: Classic duplicates from re-scraping

**Example**:
```
Title: "Jazz Night"
Venue: "Six D.O.G.S"
Date: 2025-11-15
→ Keeps first occurrence (by source priority + description length)
```

**Why it's needed**: Catches duplicates where URL might be missing or different tracking parameters added.

**Keeps**:
1. Preferred source
2. Longest description
3. First by ID (if tie)

---

### PASS 3: Cross-Source Time Window (±3 days) 🌐

**What it catches**: Same event from different sources with slightly different dates

**Example**:
```
viva.gr:  "Guitar Experience 2025" - Nov 26
more.com: "Guitar Experience 2025" - Nov 27
→ Same event, 1 day apart → keeps more.com version
```

**Algorithm**:
- Groups events into 3-day buckets
- Only considers if from DIFFERENT sources
- Only if dates are ≤3 days apart

**Keeps**:
1. Preferred source (more.com is usually more accurate)
2. Longest description

---

### PASS 4: Fuzzy Title Match (Case-Insensitive) 🔤

**What it catches**: Title variations with different capitalization/spacing

**Example**:
```
"JAZZ NIGHT"
"Jazz Night"
"jazz night"
→ All normalized to "jazz night" → keeps longest original title
```

**Normalization**: `LOWER(TRIM(title))`

**Keeps**:
1. Longest title (e.g., "Jazz Night at Six D.O.G.S" > "JAZZ NIGHT")
2. Preferred source
3. Longest description

---

### PASS 5: Venue Normalization 🏛️

**What it catches**: Venue names with punctuation differences

**Example**:
```
"Gazarte Main Stage"
"Gazarte Main Stage!"
"Gazarte - Main Stage"
→ All normalized to "Gazarte Main Stage" → keeps longest
```

**Normalization**: Removes `!`, `-`, `.`

**Keeps**:
1. Longest venue name (most complete)
2. Preferred source

---

### PASS 6: Default Time Deduplication ⏰

**What it catches**: Events with scraper default times (18:00, 22:00)

**Example**:
```
"Concert X" at "Venue Y"
- Entry 1: 18:00 (scraper default)
- Entry 2: 20:00 (actual time)
→ Keeps 20:00 version (more realistic)
```

**Time Preference** (best to worst):
1. 20:00 (most common realistic time)
2. 21:00
3. 19:00
4. 22:00 (possible but often default)
5. 18:00 (likely scraper default)

**Keeps**:
1. Most realistic time
2. Preferred source
3. Longest description

---

## Quality Ranking Logic

When choosing which duplicate to keep, the script uses this priority order:

### 1. Source Priority
```typescript
more.com     → 1 (highest quality, most detail)
viva.gr      → 2 (good quality)
gazarte.gr   → 3 (venue-specific)
email        → 4 (newsletters, varies)
```

### 2. Content Length
```sql
LENGTH(title) DESC                    -- Longer title = more descriptive
LENGTH(COALESCE(description, '')) DESC -- Longer description = more detail
```

### 3. Time Realism (for Pass 6)
```
20:00 > 21:00 > 19:00 > 22:00 > 18:00
```

### 4. First ID (Tie-Breaker)
If everything else is equal, keeps the first one encountered.

## Additional Advanced Techniques (Not Yet Implemented)

### 7. Levenshtein Distance (String Similarity)

**What it would catch**: Typos and close variations

**Example**:
```
"Jazzz Night"  (typo)
"Jazz Night"   (correct)
→ Distance: 1 character → likely duplicate
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Would require custom SQLite function
SELECT * FROM events e1, events e2
WHERE levenshtein_distance(e1.title, e2.title) <= 2
  AND e1.venue_name = e2.venue_name
  AND e1.date = e2.date;
```

**Complexity**: Requires loading a Levenshtein SQLite extension or implementing in TypeScript.

---

### 8. Semantic Similarity (AI-Based)

**What it would catch**: Same event with completely different wording

**Example**:
```
"Mozart's Requiem Performance"
"Requiem in D minor by W.A. Mozart"
→ Same piece, different titles
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Use embeddings to compare semantic similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(
  await getEmbedding(title1),
  await getEmbedding(title2)
);
if (similarity > 0.85) {
  // Likely duplicate
}
```

**Pros**: Catches semantically identical events with different wording
**Cons**: Requires AI API calls (cost), slower, can have false positives

---

### 9. Artist Name Extraction & Matching

**What it would catch**: Same artist with different event names

**Example**:
```
"Nick Cave - Live in Athens"
"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Athens Concert"
→ Same artist, different event names
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Extract artist names using NER (Named Entity Recognition)
const artist1 = extractArtist("Nick Cave - Live in Athens");
const artist2 = extractArtist("Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Athens Concert");

if (artist1 === artist2 && sameVenue && sameDateRange) {
  // Likely duplicate
}
```

**Pros**: Very accurate for music events
**Cons**: Requires NLP library, doesn't work for non-music events

---

### 10. Phone Number / Address Matching

**What it would catch**: Same venue with different names

**Example**:
```
Venue: "Six D.O.G.S"
Address: "6-8 Avramiotou St, Athens"

Venue: "6 DOGS"
Address: "6-8 Avramiotou St, Athens"
→ Same physical location
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM events e1, events e2
WHERE e1.venue_address = e2.venue_address
  AND e1.title = e2.title
  AND e1.date = e2.date
  AND e1.venue_name != e2.venue_name;
```

**Pros**: Catches venue name variations
**Cons**: Requires accurate address data (often missing)

---

### 11. Price-Based Deduplication

**What it would catch**: Free vs paid versions of same event

**Example**:
```
"Free Opening Night - Jazz Festival"
Price: €0

"Jazz Festival - Day 1"
Price: €15
→ Different events OR price error
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Flag for manual review if price differs significantly
SELECT title, venue_name, date, GROUP_CONCAT(price) as prices
FROM events
GROUP BY title, venue_name, date
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT price) > 1
  AND (MAX(price) - MIN(price)) > 10;
```

**Pros**: Catches pricing errors
**Cons**: Often legitimate (early bird vs regular pricing)

---

### 12. Recurring Event Detection

**What it would catch**: Multi-date runs (theater, exhibitions)

**Example**:
```
"Hamlet" - Nov 1
"Hamlet" - Nov 2
"Hamlet" - Nov 3
→ KEEP ALL (it's a recurring show, not duplicates)
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Detect recurring patterns
SELECT title, venue_name,
       COUNT(*) as occurrences,
       MIN(date) as first_date,
       MAX(date) as last_date
FROM events
GROUP BY title, venue_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
  AND (julianday(MAX(date)) - julianday(MIN(date))) > 7;
```

**Pros**: Avoids falsely removing legitimate recurring events
**Cons**: Hard to distinguish from true duplicates

---

### 13. Image Hash Comparison

**What it would catch**: Same event with same promotional image

**Example**:
```
Event 1: poster_image_hash = abc123
Event 2: poster_image_hash = abc123
→ Same promotional material = likely same event
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
import { imageHash } from 'image-hash-library';

const hash1 = await imageHash(event1.imageUrl);
const hash2 = await imageHash(event2.imageUrl);

if (hash1 === hash2) {
  // Very likely duplicate
}
```

**Pros**: Very reliable for events with images
**Cons**: Requires downloading images, compute-heavy

---

### 14. Time Zone Normalization

**What it would catch**: Same event with timezone confusion

**Example**:
```
Event 1: 2025-11-15 20:00 (UTC)
Event 2: 2025-11-15 22:00 (EET)
→ Same time, different timezone representation
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
import { DateTime } from 'luxon';

const time1 = DateTime.fromISO(event1.start_date, { zone: 'UTC' });
const time2 = DateTime.fromISO(event2.start_date, { zone: 'Europe/Athens' });

if (time1.equals(time2)) {
  // Same actual time
}
```

**Pros**: Handles timezone issues
**Cons**: agent-athens already normalizes to Europe/Athens

---

## Current Workflow (After Import)

```bash
# 1. Import events
bun run scripts/import-scraped-events.ts

# 2. Filter Athens-only
bun run scripts/filter-athens-only.ts

# 3. Remove duplicates (preview first)
bun run scripts/remove-duplicates.ts --dry-run

# 4. If looks good, apply
bun run scripts/remove-duplicates.ts

# 5. Rebuild site
bun run build

# 6. Deploy
git add data/events.db dist/
git commit -m "chore: Import + deduplicate $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin main
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Script Performance

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) per pass (due to SQL sorting)
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for GROUP_CONCAT operations
**Typical Runtime**: 2-5 seconds for 1,000 events

### Optimization Tips

1. **Index Key Columns**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_url ON events(url);
CREATE INDEX idx_title_venue_date ON events(title, venue_name, date(start_date));
```

2. **Run Passes in Order**:
   - URL-based removes most duplicates first
   - Subsequent passes have fewer rows to check

3. **Use Dry-Run for Testing**:
   - Always run `--dry-run` first on production data
   - Verify removal counts before applying

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script removes legitimate recurring events

**Solution**: Add to recurring event whitelist
```typescript
const RECURRING_EVENT_PATTERNS = [
  'ΦΘΙΝΟΠΩΡΙΝΗ ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑ',  // Theater show with multiple dates
  // Add more patterns
];
```

### Issue: Cross-source duplicates with very different dates

**Solution**: Increase time window from 3 to 5 days
```sql
CAST((julianday(start_date) - julianday('2025-01-01')) / 5 AS INTEGER)
```

### Issue: False positives in fuzzy matching

**Solution**: Add minimum title length requirement
```sql
WHERE LENGTH(title) > 10  -- Avoid matching short generic titles
```
