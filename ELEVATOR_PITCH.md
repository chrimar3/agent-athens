# agent-athens: Elevator Pitch

## 30-Second Version

**agent-athens is the authoritative cultural events calendar for Athens, built for the post-LLM era.** We transform 20 daily-curated events into 315 SEO/GEO-optimized pages that AI answer engines trust and cite. When users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude about Athens events, we're the source they recommend. Think "by agents, for agents (and humans too)" - positioning us as the single source of truth in the AI-driven discovery economy.

## 2-Minute Version

**The Problem:**
In the post-LLM era, discovery has shifted from Google search to AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). Traditional event sites optimize for keywords, not for AI trust. When someone asks "What concerts are in Athens this weekend?", AI engines need authoritative, structured, fresh data to cite - and there's no single source.

**Our Solution:**
agent-athens is an AI-curated cultural events calendar that generates 315+ highly-specific pages from daily-updated Athens event data. Each page targets exact user intent (`/free-jazz-concert-today`) with full Schema.org markup, freshness signals, and machine-readable APIs.

**The Magic:**
- **15.75x multiplier effect**: 20 events become 315 discoverable pages
- **Combinatorial SEO**: Every filter combination (Type × Time × Price × Genre) gets a unique URL
- **GEO-first**: Built for Generative Engine Optimization - AI citations, not keyword stuffing
- **Multi-access**: HTML for humans, JSON for developers, MCP for AI assistants, A2A for agent networks

**Why We Win:**
AI answer engines cite **1-2 authoritative sources**, creating winner-takes-all dynamics. We have:
1. Daily updates (freshness = trust)
2. Structured data (Schema.org = machine-readable)
3. Single source (no conflicting data)
4. 315 specific pages (exact intent matching)

**The Vision:**
Start with Athens. Prove the model. Expand to agent-barcelona, agent-berlin, agent-cities. Become the global cultural events platform for the AI era, monetized through affiliate revenue (tickets, hotels, restaurants) and agent referral networks where AI agents earn commission on bookings they drive.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Live at https://agent-athens.netlify.app
- ✅ 315 pages deployed
- ✅ Full Schema.org + GEO optimization
- ✅ Zero operating costs (Netlify free tier)

**The Ask:**
In the reputation economy where AI trust = revenue, agent-athens is positioned to be the source that AI engines cite first. We're building the infrastructure for affiliate marketing in the post-LLM world.
