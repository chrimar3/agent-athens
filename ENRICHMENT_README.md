# Event Enrichment Guide

## Overview
Event enrichment uses Claude Code tool_agent to generate detailed 400-word descriptions for events, enhancing the basic scraped data with compelling cultural context and storytelling.

This approach is **FREE** - it uses your existing Claude Code subscription instead of paying per API call.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated
- Events in database (run scraping first)

### Run Enrichment
Use Claude Code interactively:

```bash
# Ask Claude Code:
"Generate 400-word descriptions for all events in the database that don't have fullDescription.
Use the enrichment prompt template and update the database."
```

Claude Code will:
1. Query unenriched events from the database
2. Generate compelling descriptions using extended thinking
3. Update each event's `full_description` field
4. Maintain rate limits automatically

## How It Works

### Input
The script:
- Loads all events from the database
- Finds events without `fullDescription` (or with descriptions < 100 words)
- For each event, builds a detailed prompt with event metadata

### AI Generation
Each prompt instructs Claude to:
- Write exactly 400 words (Â±20 acceptable)
- Start with a compelling hook
- Provide cultural context (who is the artist/exhibition)
- Explain what makes the event special
- Include practical details naturally
- End with a call-to-action
- Use engaging, accessible English (not marketing fluff)
- Focus on cultural value and experience
- Mention Athens neighborhood connections when relevant
- Never fabricate facts

### Output
- Generates ~400-word description for each event
- Stores in `full_description` column in database
- Updates `updated_at` timestamp
- Rate-limited to 2 seconds between requests (avoid API limits)

## Database Schema

Events are stored with:
- `description`: Short 1-2 sentence summary (from scraping)
- `full_description`: AI-generated 400-word article (from enrichment)

## Daily Workflow

1. **Scraping** (scripts/scrape-events.ts)
   - Fetches new events from sources
   - Extracts basic metadata + short descriptions
   - Inserts into database

2. **Enrichment** (scripts/enrich-events.ts)
   - Finds events without full descriptions
   - Generates 400-word articles with Claude
   - Updates database

3. **Site Generation** (src/generate-site.ts)
   - Loads enriched events from database
   - Cleans up past events (older than 1 day)
   - Filters to only show today/future events
   - Generates all 336 static pages

## Event Lifecycle & Cleanup

### Automatic Date Handling
The site generator implements smart date filtering:

```typescript
// Filter to events happening today or later
const now = new Date();
const events = allEvents.filter(event => {
  const eventDate = new Date(event.startDate);
  return eventDate >= new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
});
```

This automatically handles:
- **Tomorrow becomes today**: No manual updates needed
- **Past events disappear**: Only current/future events are published
- **Database cleanup**: Events older than 1 day are deleted on each generation

### Example
- **Day 1 (Oct 18):**
  - "Today" shows events for Oct 18
  - "Tomorrow" shows events for Oct 19

- **Day 2 (Oct 19):**
  - "Today" shows events for Oct 19 (what was "tomorrow" yesterday)
  - "Tomorrow" shows events for Oct 20
  - Oct 18 events are deleted from database and don't appear anywhere

## Cost Estimation

- **Claude Code**: $0 (included in subscription)
- **Time investment**: ~2-3 minutes for 10 events
- **Ideal for**: Daily/weekly enrichment workflows

## Error Handling

The script handles:
- Missing API key (exits with helpful message)
- Rate limiting (waits 30s if hit 429 error)
- Individual event failures (logs and continues)
- Progress tracking (shows count of enriched vs errors)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Tags**: Extract themes, moods, audiences from descriptions
2. **Greek Translation**: Generate bilingual descriptions
3. **Image Generation**: AI-generated event visuals
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Tag events by vibe (intimate, energetic, contemplative)
5. **Cross-Event Recommendations**: "If you like X, you'll love Y"
